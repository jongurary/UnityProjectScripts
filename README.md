# UnityProjectScripts
Various projects I've done in C# over the years. Some portions may be subject to copyright.

VRPass, developed by myself in 2016, is the proof-of-concept application behind the virtual reality authentication technology that eventually led to patent US10963544B2. It allows users to traverse a home in VR, and interact with all kinds of things in the environment like light switches, doors, televisions, etc.

Also included are scripts behind an RTS title that I did some work on in 2017/2018. It remains unfinished. The core gameplay revolves around generating electricity and distributing it in a power grid composed of substations, lines, generators, etc.

VRSpace is a VR space combat title I started producing in mid-2020. Core gameplay is more or less finished, expecting release around 2022-2023. It's a fairly advanced project with a lot of physics and vector maths.
