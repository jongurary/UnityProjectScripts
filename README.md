Various projects I've done in C# over the years. Some portions may be subject to copyright.

VRPass is the proof-of-concept application behind the virtual reality authentication technology that eventually led to patent US10963544B2.

Also included are scripts behind an RTS title that I did some work on in 2017/2018.

VRSpace is a VR space combat title I started producing in mid-2020. Core gameplay is more or less finished.
